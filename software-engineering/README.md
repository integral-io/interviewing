# Software Engineering @ Integral

This document aims to explain the steps you could experience during our interview process.

We are not the biggest fan of the traditional interview process, largely because of the lack
of information parity between the candidate and the company.  Therefore, expect plenty of dialogue
throughout the entire process. Hopefully both of us will have the information we need to
know to make the right decision.

## Software Engineering Practices

Integral's software engineering practices are strongly influenced by extreme programming (XP).
Test-driven development (TDD) and pair programming are the most obvious examples that you would experience
from working at Integral.  Therefore, it should not come as a surprise that we would be
talking a lot about TDD and pairing during the our interview process.

## Interview Steps

1. Connect with Integral. Either reach out to us at careers@integral.io, or we could reach out to you.
1. Speak with our recruiter to learn about our company and for us to learn about yourself.
1. Complete coding exercise (clarified below).
1. Remote pair program on your code submssion with one of our engineers.
1. On-site pair with us on a production / production-like codebase.

## Coding Exercise

The coding exercise provides a medium for us to chat about software engineering. It also serves as
the foundation for the next step in the process.

Therefore, we aim to select an exercise that has enough "meat" for discuss, while respecting
everyone's time and obligations beyond interviewing.

### The Exercise

Please implement the [following kata][interview kata] and follow the guidelines specified below.

#### Time Limit Requirements

Please spend a **maxium** of two (2) hours on doing the kata.  As stated above, we want to respect your
time and obligations outside of the interview process.  Additionally, the subsequent step involves pairing
with one of our engineers on your code submission for the kata.  Keeping these two things in mind.  Please
do not feel the pressure to complete the kata.

To re-iterate, please spend maximum 2 hours on doing the kata.  And the evaluation of your code submission
**does not depend on completing the kata**.

#### Code Quality and Methodology

Implement the features focusing on **writing the best code** you can produce.  To us, TDD is an indispensable
tool for producing high quality code.  Therefore, we encourage you to incorporate TDD into your kata.

### Technical Requirements

- Interfaces: User-facing interfaces (i.e. Web, Console, etc.) are not necessary.
- Language: Use any version of Java with build system (i.e. Maven or Gradle).
- Dependencies: Use any dependencies necessary.

#### Code Submission

Add the code to your own Github account and send us the link.

## Remote Pairing Exercise

Once your code has been submitted, we would have an opportunity to discuss and remote pair
on the kata starting with the code you have submitted.

Expect the discussion to be conversational, covering topics such as:
- Your thoughts on the exercise
  - What you liked about the exercise
  - What frustrated or confused you about the exercise
- How did you approach the problem?
  - What influenced your design?
  - What are the changes you want to make but wasn't able to because of the time constraint?

These are not meant to be exhaustive nor is it guaranteed that we would talk about all of them.

## On-site Pairing

Come into our office. Meet the team. Experience the environment. Pair with our engineers!
