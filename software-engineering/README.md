# Software Engineering @ Integral

Integral's software engineering practices are strongly influenced by extreme programming (XP).
Test-driven development (TDD) and pair programming are the most obvious examples of working at Integral.

## Interview Steps

1. Connect with Integral, either by you reaching out to us or us reaching out to you.
1. Speak with our recruiter to learn about our company and for us to learn about yourself.
1. Complete coding exercise (clarified below).
1. Pair program with one of our engineers on your code submission from the step before.
1. Pair program with us in our office so you can gain a more accurate understanding of what it is like to be at Integral.

## Coding Exercise

The coding exercise provides a medium for you and us to chat about and explore software engineering.
Therefore, we aim to select an exercise that has enough "meat" for you and us to discuss, while respecting
everyone's time and obligations beyond interviewing.

### The Exercise

Please implement the [following kata][interview kata] and follow the guidelines specified below.

#### Time Limit Requirements

Please spend **maxium** of two (2) hours on doing the kata.  As stated above, we want to respect candidate's
time and obligations outside of the interview process.  Additionally, the subsequent step involves pairing
with one of our engineers on your code submission for this step.

To re-iterate, please spend maximum 2 hours on doing the kata.  And the evaluation of your code submission
**does not depend on completing the kata**.

#### Code Quality and Methodology

Implement the features focusing on **writing the best code** you can produce.  To us, test-driven
development is an indispensable tool for producing high quality code.  Therefore, we encourage you
to incorporate TDD into your kata.

### Technical Requirements

- Language: Use any version of Java with build system (i.e. Maven or Gradle).
- Dependencies: Use any dependencies necessary.
- Interfaces: User-facing interfaces (i.e. Web, Console, etc.) are not necessary.

#### Code Submission

Add the code to your own Github account and send us the link.
